# Demo 0: Installing

## macOS

### With Homebrew

Run `make install_mac` to install both Homebrew (macOS package manager) and Docker.

If you already have Homebrew installed, run:

`brew cask install docker`

### GUI installer

[Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) - install the `Stable channel`


## Windows

[Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) - install the `Stable channel`

Note: I haven't worked with Docker for Windows and unfortunately can't provide much guidance beyond providing documentation.

## Linux

### Ubuntu

#### Install from Docker documentation

[Docker CE for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce)

#### Install with the provided Makefile:

`make install_ubuntu`

Note that this assumes you have `x86_64` or `amd64` architecture. If you don't know, it's probably one of these :)

If you are using a different chip, you can pass an `ARCH=<chip>`to the make target (e.g. `make install_ubuntu ARCH=armfh`) :

architecture   | chip value
---------------|-----------------
x86_64 / amd64 | amd64
armhf          | armfh
IBM Power      | ppc64le
IBM Z          | s390x


### Other Linux Distributions

* [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
* [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/)
* [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/)



# Demo 1: The Basics

The first demo will cover:

- basic Dockerfile syntax

- building Docker images

- running Docker containers

We'll be building an image and running a container that prints information about the operating system and kernel.

## Dockerfile

Open up the `Dockerfile`. Each line starts with an instruction in all-caps: this is the command that we're giving to the Docker daemon when we run `docker build` to tell it how to build our image.


FROM - specifies the base image we're starting off of. Docker images are like onions: they have layers.
WORKDIR - sets the working directory to the path specified
RUN - executes a command against the container, like installing a package or changing file permissions
COPY - copies specified files and directories from your host machine into the container
ENV - sets an environment variable
ENTRYPOINT - denotes the command that should be executed when the container is run

Within the Dockerfile, you should see comments annotating how we're using these commands more specifically in this case.

## Docker build

[docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)

The `build` command is used to build images from a Dockerfile in the path that's passed to it. (In this case, the path is `.`, the current working directory.)

The `--tag` options allows us to label the container we're writing with a name and a version. (In this case, we're naming it `nuwit` and giving it the version `demo-1`.)

`docker build --tag nuwit:demo-1 .`

To confirm that it worked, you can run the `docker images` command, which lists the Docker images you have locally. You should see the image we just created in the output.

`docker images`

## Docker run

Now, we can run the image we just built. Use `docker run` with the iamge name and version (`nuwit:demo-1`) to start a container:

`docker run nuwit:demo-1`


You should see output similar to the following:
